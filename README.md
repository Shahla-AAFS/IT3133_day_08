Using React Router DOM 
This repository demonstrates how to build a simple React application with React Router DOM for navigation and routing. The application includes multiple pages such as Home, About, Contact Us, Login, and a protected Dashboard accessible only to authenticated users.
#Features
React Router DOM: Navigate seamlessly between multiple pages without reloading.
Login Authentication: Basic form validation for username and password.
Error Handling: Informative error messages for invalid login attempts or empty fields.
Responsive Design: Adaptable layout for various screen sizes.
Modular Structure: Each component is well-organized for reusability and scalability.
